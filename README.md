# [The Odin Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)

## What I've learned
- Difficult at first to grasp how everything has a "State", modifying it, updating it, passing it to other components as a prop. I'm still gathering my head around this one.

- I still don't know the right "Best-Practices" but I guess I will learn this as I go and make mistakes.

- The ```onChange``` .. ```onClick``` among the other things that can be done, figuring out how to properly use these. Having functions passed as props to use in parent elements.

- Especially tough having dynamic elements, and states that can have parts added to it (Including HTML that is added once you map over a list). Using ```fn.map()``` and ```fn.filter``` to add, modify and remove elements from list - which then update the State.
## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
